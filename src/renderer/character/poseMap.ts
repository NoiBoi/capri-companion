 * Which pose of the model fits what she is doing. Lying down and sitting need something under her:
 * on the taskbar she lies along it or hovers just above it; on a window top she sits on the
 * edge. With nothing under her she floats upright or with her knees drawn up — she never lies or sits
 * on thin air. Turning away for a moment to look at your screen, she shows her back (n 3:33,
 * standing in the sky, so it works floating too); otherwise she always faces you.
